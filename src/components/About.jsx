          Hi, Iâ€™m <span className="font-semibold text-white">Dhruva S</span>, 
          a first-year student at Cambridge Institute of Technology.  
          Iâ€™ve recently started my journey into programming, with a strong focus on 
          <span className="text-teal-400"> Java</span>.  
          I use <span className="text-teal-400">Linux</span> as my main operating system and love exploring 
          tools like <span className="text-teal-400">Git</span> and 
          <span className="text-teal-400"> GitHub</span> to manage my projects and code.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
          Iâ€™m passionate about learning new technologies and applying them to real-world problems.  
          My current goal is to gain valuable industry experience through a good internship, where I 
          can contribute, learn, and grow as a developer.
        </p>

        <p className="text-lg text-gray-400 italic">
          ðŸ’¡ Open to internships, collaborations, and projects that help me grow as a software developer.
